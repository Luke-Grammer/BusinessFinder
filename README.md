# CSCE-315-Project-2

This is a web application designed to retrieve reviews for local businesses and perform sentiment analysis in order to determine the overall public perception of each business in more detail than a simple 5-star rating system.

In order to run this application, make sure you first start the Node.js Server (The file 'Server.js) simulating the back-end server-side functionality of the application. This will require first installing Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and then running the command 'node Server.js' from the command prompt in the directory of the downloaded application. The project can then be viewed in any modern browser by running 'index.html'.

Note: The application requires that the user disable adblockers on the page. If you receive a status message indicating that an adblocker has caused a problem, that is why.
